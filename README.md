**Grainy Gradient Navbar**
---

This is a lightweight and customizable navbar component I built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a subtle grainy gradient texture, giving it a unique, modern aesthetic. 

You can easily customize:
- The background color to suit your project's theme.
- The names, links, and dropdown menus to fit your content.

I created this as a flexible UI/UX component that’s easy to integrate into your projects. Feel free to fork it, tweak it, and make it your own—I’d love to see how you use it!
